# Unless you specify which option file to use (with the command line
# option "--options filename"), the file ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf is used
# by dirmngr.  The file can contain any long options which are valid
# for Dirmngr.  If the first non white space character of a line is a
# '#', the line is ignored.  Empty lines are also ignored.  See the
# dirmngr man page or the manual for a list of options.

# --keyserver URI
#
# GPG can send and receive keys to and from a keyserver.  These
# servers can be HKP, Email, or LDAP (if GnuPG is built with LDAP
# support).
#
# Example HKP keyservers:
#      hkp://keys.gnupg.net
#
# Example HKP keyserver using a Tor hidden service
#      hkp://dyh2j3qyrirn43iw.onion
#
# Example HKPS keyservers (see --hkp-cacert below):
#       hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
#
# Example LDAP keyservers:
#      ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370
#
# Regular URL syntax applies, and you can set an alternate port
# through the usual method:
#      hkp://keyserver.example.net:22742
#
# Most users just set the name and type of their preferred keyserver.
# Note that most servers (with the notable exception of
# ldap://keyserver.pgp.com) synchronize changes with each other.  Note
# also that a single server name may actually point to multiple
# servers via DNS round-robin.  hkp://keys.gnupg.net is an example of
# such a "server", which spreads the load over a number of physical
# servers.
#
# If exactly two keyservers are configured and only one is a Tor hidden
# service, Dirmngr selects the keyserver to use depending on whether
# Tor is locally running or not (on a per session base).

keyserver hkp://dyh2j3qyrirn43iw.onion
keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net

# --hkp-cacert FILENAME
#
# For the "hkps" scheme (keyserver access over TLS), Dirmngr needs to
# know the root certificates for verification of the TLS certificates
# used for the connection.  Enter the full name of a file with the
# root certificates here.  If that file is in PEM format a ".pem"
# suffix is expected.  This option may be given multiple times to add
# more root certificates.  Tilde expansion is supported.
